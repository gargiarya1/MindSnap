                        <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP)- is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. NLP techniques include text analysis, sentiment analysis, language translation, and speech recognition, among others.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Introduction to NLP:
                                    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way. It combines linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to bridge the gap between human communication and computational understanding.</li>
                                <li>Key Components:
                                    NLP involves several key components, including text processing, syntactic and semantic analysis, machine translation, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering. These components work together to extract meaning, structure, and context from unstructured natural language data, enabling applications like virtual assistants, chatbots, and language translation systems.</li>
                                <li>Text Processing:
                                    Text processing is the initial step in NLP, involving tasks like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to break down text into its basic units and normalize it for analysis. This process enhances the efficiency and accuracy of subsequent NLP tasks by reducing complexity and variability in language representation.</li>
                                <li>Syntactic and Semantic Analysis:
                                    Syntactic analysis focuses on understanding the grammatical structure of sentences, while semantic analysis delves into the meaning of words and phrases in context. Techniques such as parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing help NLP systems comprehend the relationships between words and their roles within sentences.</li>
                                <li>Machine Translation:
                                    Machine translation aims to automatically translate text from one language to another, leveraging NLP techniques such as statistical modeling, neural networks, and sequence-to-sequence architectures. Despite challenges like ambiguity and idiomatic expressions, advances in NLP have led to significant improvements in the accuracy and fluency of machine translation systems.</li>
                                <li>Sentiment Analysis:
                                    Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone conveyed in text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. NLP techniques like classification algorithms, sentiment lexicons, and deep learning models enable automated sentiment analysis of social media posts, customer reviews, and other text data, aiding businesses in understanding customer opinions and feedback.</li>
                                <li>Named Entity Recognition:
                                    Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies and classifies named entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and numerical expressions. NER plays a crucial role in information extraction, entity linking, and knowledge graph construction, facilitating tasks like information retrieval and data mining from large text corpora.</li>
                                <li>Question Answering:
                                    Question answering systems use NLP techniques to understand questions posed in natural language and provide accurate answers by analyzing relevant textual sources. These systems employ methods like information retrieval, passage ranking, and natural language understanding to comprehend queries and retrieve pertinent information from structured or unstructured data sources.</li>
