                        <p>Computer networks enable devices to communicate and share resources, forming a digital infrastructure vital for modern communication. They facilitate data transfer and resource sharing among computers and other devices over wired or wireless connections. Networks vary in scale, from local area networks (LANs) within a limited area to wide area networks (WANs) spanning large geographical areas. Protocols like TCP/IP govern data transmission, ensuring reliable communication across diverse network architectures.</p>

                                <li>Introduction to Computer Networks:
                                    Computer networks enable communication and resource sharing among multiple devices. They range from local area networks (LANs) connecting devices in proximity to wide area networks (WANs) spanning vast geographical areas. Networks facilitate data transfer through various mediums such as cables, fiber optics, and wireless connections. Protocols like TCP/IP govern communication, ensuring seamless exchange of data across diverse network architectures.</li>
                                <li>Types of Computer Networks:
                                    Computer networks come in various forms including LANs, WANs, metropolitan area networks (MANs), and personal area networks (PANs). LANs connect devices within a limited area like homes or offices, while WANs link geographically distant networks. MANs cover larger areas like cities, and PANs interconnect devices for personal use. Each type serves specific purposes, offering scalability and flexibility in network design.</li>
                                <li>Network Topologies:
                                    Network topologies define the physical or logical layout of devices in a network. Common topologies include star, bus, ring, mesh, and hybrid configurations. The star topology centralizes connections through a hub or switch, while the bus topology uses a single cable for communication. Ring networks form a closed loop, and mesh networks offer redundant paths for fault tolerance.</li>
                                <li>Networking Devices:
                                    Networking devices facilitate communication and data exchange within networks. Examples include routers, switches, hubs, modems, and access points. Routers manage data traffic between different networks, while switches enable communication within a single network. Hubs connect multiple devices in a LAN, and modems facilitate communication between digital devices and analog systems like telephone lines.</li>
                                <li>Network Protocols:
                                    Network protocols define rules and conventions for communication between devices in a network. Popular protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and SNMP. TCP/IP governs internet communication, while HTTP facilitates web browsing. FTP enables file transfer, and SNMP manages network devices. Protocols ensure standardized and efficient data exchange, promoting interoperability among diverse network devices and systems.</li>
                                <li>Network Security:
                                    Network security aims to protect data and resources from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. It encompasses measures such as encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and access controls. Encryption secures data during transmission, while firewalls filter network traffic. IDS detect and respond to suspicious activities, and access controls limit user privileges, safeguarding network integrity and confidentiality.</li>
                                <li>Wireless Networking:
                                    Wireless networks use radio waves or infrared signals to transmit data without physical cables. They offer mobility and flexibility, supporting devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks are common wireless technologies. Wi-Fi enables local wireless internet access, Bluetooth connects devices over short distances, and cellular networks provide mobile communication over vast areas.</li>
                                <li>Network Management:
                                    Network management involves monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing network performance and resources. It includes tasks like network configuration, performance analysis, and fault management. Network administrators use tools like network management systems (NMS) to oversee network operations, ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficient utilization of network resources. Effective network management is crucial for maintaining smooth and uninterrupted communication in modern digital environments.</li>
